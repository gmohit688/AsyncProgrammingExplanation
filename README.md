Firstly it demostrate the synchronous programming. If we will run the solution it will start the task execution and complete all the task one after another
and it will take total 6 seconds to execute.

After first PR merged to master branch, it shows how asynchronous programming improves the performance. We are able to execute all the tasks parallely and able to complete them in 2 seconds of total time.
